Cytokine - time plot, instead of bins, using full day range
- n for box plot, below 0

All box plots - limit 1 per patient
- Max within time group

Regression - poly 2

Cytokines: Same time ranges as above

Exclude 44plex w/o match in 30plex


Verify that we're taking mean of each cytokine value per patient
# Adjusting results by dilution factor
summarise(result = mean(result)*2)



fun_flow_png -> duplicated str_replace

For time plot - 1/max per time group

Flow: Day 10+ for boxplot
Flow: Day 1-9

Boxplots by time?
